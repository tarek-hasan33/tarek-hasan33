### Hey there!!! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Tarek Hasan**](https://tarekhasan.com), a 22-year-old undergrad student and a wannabe tech wizard from Bangladesh!

I'm currently doing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at [**@United International University](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/). Balancing studies with everything else—just trying to survive!

Alongside my studies and my goal of becoming a software engineer, I’m fascinated by the AI industry and have a growing interest in cybersecurity as well. While I haven’t made any contributions to these fields yet, I’m eager to learn and explore!

I love learning and self-improvement, watching football, playing video games and [**chess**](https://www.chess.com/member/liddleheart), occasionally reading books, and perhaps slowly but surely becoming a serioholic.
